## Introduction

In this project, we utilized the Spaceship Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger is transported to an alternate dimension based on various features like age, expenditure on services, home planet, etc.

## Data Preprocessing

We performed several preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between different features. This included visualizing the data with histograms, pie charts, and bar plots.

## Machine Learning Modeling

We implemented and evaluated various machine learning models. The models were trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

We trained following machine learning models
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Multi-Layer Perceptron
- K Nearest Neighbour

## Evaluation

We performed comprehensive evaluation on the models, including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC AUC Curve
